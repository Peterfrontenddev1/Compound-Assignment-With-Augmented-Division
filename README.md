# Compound-Assignment-With-Augmented-Division

The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;

Will divide myVar by 5. 

This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

a should equal 4.

b should equal 27.

c should equal 3.

You should use the /= operator for each variable.

You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;
